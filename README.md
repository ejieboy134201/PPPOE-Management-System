Aqueous extract of Euphorbia hirta L. was prepared in hot water and crude extract
yield (7%w/w) after lyophilization was used for antioxidant potential
determination. The quantitative estimation of major constituents of crude extract
was carried out using standard methods and contained total sugar (29.53 mg
glucose equivalent), total phenol (52.92 mg gallic acid equivalent) and total
flavonoid (18.57 mg rutin equivalent) per gram crude extract. The total antioxidant
potential of crude extract was determined using phosphomolybdenum complex and
ferric reducing power (FRAP) assays, which showed 185 µmol of ascorbic acid and
398 µmol Fe (II) equivalent per gram crude extract, respectively. The crude extract
exhibited significant free radical scavenging activity of 247 µmol Trolox equivalent
per gram crude extract and IC 50 value 0.175 mg crude extract / ml, as revealed by
(ABTS•
*) [2,2’-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid )] and DPPH (2,
2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assays, respectively.
Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was performed using deoxyribose assay as
well as calf thymus DNA oxidative damage assays and results showed significant
hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC 50 value 0.162 mg crude extract/ml).
Lipid peroxidation inhibition potential of crude extract evaluated using mouse brain
tissue homogenate, showed significant inhibition potential IC50 value 0.143mg
crude extract per ml. In Indian traditional medicine, importance of E. hirta L. is
well evidenced from earlier literature, but this is first in vitro report showing E.
hirta L. as potent source of natural antioxidants. Therefore, on the basis of present
research findings, we suggest E hirta L. as promising plant source in health, food
and cosmetic industry.
Key Words: Antioxidant, Scavenger, lipid peroxidation, hydroxyl radical, oxidative damage
The formation of reactive oxygen (ROS) may cause oxidative stress and destruction of unsaturated
lipids, DNA, proteins and other essential molecules and considered to have major role in
mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, ageing, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s (5, 6). Besides implications in health aspects, free radical is also responsible for
deterioration of food and cosmetic product quality. It has been well documented that, in addition
to endogenous antioxidant defense system, external supply of both synthetic as well plant derived
natural antioxidants appears to play significant role in oxidative stress imbalances (7, 8).

There is high demand for natural antioxidants in the food, cosmetic and therapeutic industry, due
to their low cost, high stability, high compatibility with dietary intake and no harmful effects
inside the human body, like some synthetic antioxidants BHA (Butylated Hydroxyl Anisole) and
BHT (Butylated Hydroxy Toluene) are carcinogenic in nature. On the basis of above facts, natural
antioxidants would be promising alternative for synthetic antioxidants (9, 10). The development of
alternative natural antioxidants such as those found in plants origin is of worthy consideration for
our health industry and hold promising commercial potential. Euphorbia hirta L. (family
Euphorbiaceae), a wild herbaceous plant is very common in all tropical countries, including India
and has been widely acknowledged for use in traditional medicine like cough, coryza, hay asthma,
bronchial infections, bowel complaints, worm infestations, kidney stones (1). A number of reports
have been well documented in earlier research work including sedative and anxiolytic activity (2),
analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant for blood pressure (3), antihypertensive
(4). Although, use of Euphorbia hirta L is reported for different biomedical use, the present work
is being made to explore the in vitro antioxidant potential.
Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical and highest purity and were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St., Louis, USA), Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Hi-Media, India Ltd.
and, Merck Co. (Germany).
Plant Material
Euphorbia hirta L. (family Euphorbiaceae), was collected from Shantikunj pharmacy nursery,
Haridwar, Uttarranchal was authenticated and voucher specimen kept in department of
biotechnology herbarium. Aqueous extract of fresh leaves of Euphorbia hirta L. was prepared by
boiling for two hour in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mM) and extract was filtered with double
layer cheese cloth. The filtrate was centrifuged at 10000xg for 45 minute and clear supernatant
was collected and freeze dried. Crude extract yield was (w/w 7%) and kept at -200
C for further use
in vitro antioxidant potential investigation.
Total phenol, total flavonoid and total sugar estimation
Preliminary analysis of crude extract was done for total phenol (11), total flavonoids (12) and total
sugar (13) according to standard assay methods.
Total antioxidant and total ferric reducing power determination
Total antioxidant activity was determined in terms of mg equivalent of ascorbic acid per g crude
extract using phosphomolybdate complex assay (14). The assay is spectrophotometer method,
which is based on the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) by the sample antioxidant constituents and
the subsequent formation of a green phosphate/Mo (V) complex at acidic pH which has
absorbance at 695 nm. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of plant samples is precise
interpretation of antioxidant potential in both aqueous and organic solvents medium. The FRAP
assay was performed as per procedure of (15) with slight modification. The FRAP reagent was
prepared by mixing acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10 m mol TPTZ (2, 4, 6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) solution
in 40 m mol HCl and 20 mmol ferric chloride solution in proportions of 10:1:1 (v/v), respectively.
The FRAP regent was warmed to 370
C for one hour in water bath before use in assay. Crude
extract with varied concentration (150 µL) was added to 3.0 ml of the FRAP reagent.
Pharmacologyonline 1: 91-98 (2007) Sharma et al.
93
The absorbance of the reaction mixture was taken at 593 nm after 6 min. Iron (II) sulfate solution
(100 µM-2000 µM) concentration was used as standard compound, and results were expressed as
µmol Fe (II)/g crude extract.
Assay for free radical scavenging activity using ABTS and DPPH assay
The free radical 2,2’-azinobis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS*+) was produced
reacting ABTS solution (7 mM) with (2.45 mM) potassium persulfate and mixture was allowed to
stand in dark for 12-16 hours before use. For aqueous extract ABTS was diluted with PBS (7.4
pH) to an absorbance of 0.700±0.002 at 734 nm (16) and Trolox (6-hydroxy-2, 5, 7, 8-tetramethyl2-carboxylic acid) was used as standard for calibration curve and activity was expressed in terms
of µmol TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) value. Free radical scavenging activity
was also performed by DPPH (2, 2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay. In
this assay, 2 ml of 6x10-5 M methanol solution of DPPH was mixed with 50 µL of crude extract
with varied concentration. The decrease in absorbance was recorded at 517 nm (17) and
percentage inhibition was calculated (18). BHT (Butylated Hydroxy Toluene) was used as positive
standard.
Hydroxyl radical scavenging assay
The hydroxyl radicals were generated on the basis of Fenton reaction, reaction mixture included
following reagents, 10 mM KH2PO4-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 µM Fe(SO4)2 (NH4)2-EDTA(Ethylene
Diamine Tetra Acetic acid), 1.42 mM H2O2, 0.0-1.0 mg/ml antioxidant and 2.8 mM deoxyribose
in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The extent of deoxyribose degradation due to generation hydroxyl
radical was estimated directly from the aqueous phase by the TBA method (19). Catechin(+) was
used as positive standard. Crude extract was also tested for protection against hydroxyl radical
mediated calf thymus DNA damage (20). In brief, reaction mixture contained following
components including, 100 µM FeSO4, 1 mM H2O2 and calf thymus DNA (1 mg/ml).
Assay for lipid peroxidation using mouse brain homogenate
The brain of normal rats were dissected and homogenized with a polytron in ice cold Tris-HCl
buffer(25 mM, pH 7.4) to produce a 1/10 homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged at
20000xg for 20 min. 0.5 ml of supernatant was incubated with different concentration of crude
extract powder in the presence of 25 µL FeSO4 and 100 µL H2O2 at 37 0C for one hour. The
reaction was stopped by 1 ml trichloroacetic acid (w/v 10 %) and 1.5 ml 2-thiobarbituric acid (2-
TBA, 1% w/v) was added to follow by heating at 1000
C for 15 min. The decrease in absorbance
was recorded at 532 nm for lipid peroxidation inhibition potential (21).

 Discussion
In the recent frontiers of medicine and spirit forwarded from previous research endeavor, its urge
and need for investigation of natural antioxidants from natural sources mainly dietary and
medicinal plant sources. As there are several reports on natural antioxidants of plant origin and
their importance in health, food and cosmetic industry are well acknowledged. Besides well
known and traditionally used natural antioxidants from tea, wine, fruits, vegetables and spices,
some natural antioxidant (e.g. rosemary and sage) are already exploited commercially either as
antioxidant additives or a nutritional supplements (22). Also many other plant species have been
investigated in the search for novel antioxidants (23, 24). The present work was tried to establish
in vitro antioxidant potential including ferric reducing antioxidant, free radical scavenging
activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition potential using
established assay methods. Total antioxidant activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power was
also revealed with suitable assay and was found to be significantly high (185±4.58) µmol of
ascorbic acid and (398±13.88) µmol Fe (II) equivalent per gram crude extract, respectively.
The result showed comparison to high antioxidant activity (532 µmol Fe (II)/ g dry wt.) reported
for aqueous extract of Rhodiola sacra during screening work (24). In the line of in vitro
evaluation, it was necessary to establish free radical scavenging activity of crude extract and was
performed using ABTS and DPPH free radical, which revealed appreciable scavenging activity
(247±12.58) µmol TE per gram crude extract and IC50 value (175±.098) mg crude extracts / ml,
respectively. The result of free radical scavenging activity is in accordance with the free radical
scavenging activity against ABTS and DPPH of Melissae folium infusion phenolics and
comparable to positive standard butylated hydroxy toluene with IC 50 value (0.165±0.076)
(17,18,25). Oxidative DNA damage has been implicated to be involved in various degenerative
diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Hodgkin's disease and Bloom's
syndrome (26). In view to make ascertain hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of crude extract,
Fenton reaction generated hydroxyl radical damaging assay to deoxyribose and calf thymus was
studied. The present data from our plant E hirta L. which is presented in Table.4, Fig. 4 and IC 50
value found to be (0.162±.063) mg crude extract per ml. In comparison to earlier work on dose
dependent decrease in the Fenton's reaction-mediated degradation of DNA by the presence of
plant extract of Pothomorphe peltata with IC 50 value (100-300 µg/ml) and standard catechin(+)
with IC 50 values (65µg/ml), our plant E hirta L. showed good hydroxyl radical scavenging
potential, and involved to scavenge hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (27). Lipid peroxidation,
which involves a series of free radical-mediated chain reaction processes, is also associated with
several types of biological damage. The role of free radicals and active oxygen mediated through
lipid peroxidation is becoming increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of many human
diseases, including cancer, aging and atherosclerosis (28). Inhibition potential against mouse brain
lipid peroxidation was studied and result given in Table. 5 showed significant IC 50 value
(0.143±.084) mg crude extract per ml, which is comparable to standard synthetic antioxidant BHA
IC 50 value (0.124±0.43). Our data is also in significant comparison to other plant like
Pothomorphe peltata with IC 50 value (100-500 µg/ml) reported earlier (27). Preliminary
estimation of total phenol content, total flavonoids and total sugar content was carried out and
presented in Table 1. The data showed that amount of phenolic and flavonoids found to be high
and have been in tune with previous work that the antioxidant activity of plants might be due to
their phenolic compounds (25, 29). In conclusion, in the present era of biomedicine and health
medicine, role of natural antioxidants witnessed a credible role in health, food and cosmetic
industry.

In keeping such spirit for work on natural antioxidant, we found and strongly recommend
Euphorbia hirta L. plant as source of natural antioxidant on the basis of in vitro study. In future,
we are looking forward to investigate and find out actual constituents responsible for in vitro
antioxidant potential and their role in hepatoprotective mechanism.
